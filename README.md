FloppBox
========

Simple peer-to-peer tool to synchronize files in a LAN.

Run from commandline via:
> python floppbox.py <FOLDERNAME>

<FOLDERNAME> is the name of the folder that should be synchronized.
It has to exist in the current working directory. 
Notice that the name should be unique within your network, since
it is also the name which is used to search for other clients.
